<div id="about">
    <p>
        My name is Davor Gjurcinoski, I am from Tetovo, Macedonia.  <br>
        I am currently studying software engineering at the Faculty of<br>
        Computer Science & Engineering  under the University Ss. Cyril and Methodius.<br>
        I made this website so you can learn some more thing about me, and also as<br>
        a part of my Web Design course. I have a part-time job in a computer repair<br>
        shop, and I also sometimes work as a freelancer at upwork. I like programming<br>
        but I still have a lot of things to learn. I have a lot of hobbies, like<br>
        photography, watching and playing football and basketball, I like sci-fi<br>
        movies, I like to travel etc. I used to play a lot of video games before,<br>
        but now I don't have time for it. But sometimes I play NBA 2K21 or GTA V.<br>
        I hope you will like this website, and you will be able to meet me better.<br>
